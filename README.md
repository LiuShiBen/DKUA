## Distribution-aware Knowledge Unification and Association for Non-exemplar Lifelong Person Re-identification [[Paper]]()

```
Our work proposes a novel distribution-aware knowledge unification and association (DKUA) framework where domain-style modeling is performed for each instance to propagate domain-specific representations, enhancing anti-forgetting and generalization capacity.
